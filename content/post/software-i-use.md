This is a list of software that I use. The main purpose for the existence of this page is to keep a track of the software I use and to create a place I could refer to in case I mess my system up.

## Browser
- Primary: [Firefox](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/exp/firefox/)
    Specifically [Firefox ESR](https://packages.debian.org/buster/firefox-esr)
    - Why?:
        - Free Software ♥
        - [Chrome growing into a monopoly](https://uxdesign.cc/mozilla-firefox-google-chrome-monopoly-microsoft-internet-explorer-edge-netscape-navigator-56727b258f54) and [Google being an absolute d**k.](https://gadgets.ndtv.com/apps/news/google-chrome-monopoly-complaints-gatekeeper-2044883)
    - Extensions:
        - [Adnauseum](http://adnauseum.io): \
            AdNauseam quietly clicks on every blocked ad, registering a visit on ad networks' databases. As the collected data gathered shows an omnivorous click-stream, user tracking, targeting and surveillance become futile.
        - [Bitwarden](https://bitwarden.com/): \
            My password manager of choice. If you don't use one, you should because if you don't, with the amount of software services we login to, you bet you'll reuse password between services which is a terrible idea. The alternative is to memorize a different 16+ character string for all the services you use. Seriously, use a password manager. Bitwarden works great for my use, has many useful features and is Free Software.  
        - [Sharp Color Picker](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/sharp-color-picker/): \
            Because I like good color combinations and I design stuff from time to time.
- Secondary: [Ungoogled Chromium](https://github.com/Eloston/ungoogled-chromium/): basically Chromium with all the Google bits removed.
    - Why?\
        Because I develop websites and I need to make sure the websites I make properly render across various browsers.
## Operating System
- Debian 10 [Buster]
## Text Editor
### Emacs
I use emacs for most of my text editing needs and more. Sometime ago I started working on an emacs distribution named [Armacs](https://gitlab.com/avron/armacs) that helps people get started with Emacs. Up until recently I used to for pretty much anything. Recently I started experimenting with [Doom Emacs](https://github.com/hlissner/doom-emacs/) and I've really started liking Evil Mode might actually adopt it to Armacs.
- Why?
  - Free Software ♥
  - You can get a lot done from just Emacs- text editing, git. ssh, Document editor and more!
## Terminal Emulator 
- [St](https://st.suckless.org/)
- Gnome Terminal
## Shell 
- Zsh
